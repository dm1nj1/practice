                            Put into every day language, this means that we actually grow by deeply entering into all the experiences which are presented to us, and not by consciously having growth as a goal. Conversely, once we are deeply submerged in a concrete experience the idea of growth must perish, otherwise the goal cannot be realized. If we never kill off our desire for growth and come back to our senses, we can never really get to the bottom of lifeâ€™s experiences.
